<p class="slug" align="center">Book Cover. Apollo, the god worshipped at Delphi, <br>
in an Italian 17th century fresco.

<p>The first few editions of Mastering Delphi, the best selling Delphi book I've written, provided an introduction to the Pascal language in Delphi. Due to space constraints and because many Delphi programmers look for more advanced information, in the latest edition this material was completely omitted. To overcome the absence of this information, I've started putting together this online book, titled <i><b>Essential Pascal</b></i>.
<p>This is a detailed book on Pascal, which for the moment will be available for free on my web site (I really don't know what will happen next, I might even find a publisher). This is a work in progress, and any feedback is welcome. The first complete version of this book, dated July '99, has been published on the Delphi 5 Companion CD.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Please let me know of any errors you find, but also of topics not clear enough for a beginner. I'll be able to devote time to the project depending also on the feedback I receive. Let me know also which other topics (not covered in Mastering Delphi 4) you'd like to see here. Again, hook onto the newsgroup, listed on my web site, and look for the books section, or mail to <a href="mailto:marco@marcocantu.com">marco@marcocantu.com</a> (putting <b><i>Essential Pascal</i></b> in the subject (and your request or comment in the text).

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>If I'm publishing a book on the web for free, I think this is mainly due to Bruce Eckel's experience with <i>Thinking in Java</i>. I'm a friend of Bruce and think he really did a great job with that book and few others. 
<p>As I mentioned the project to people at Borland I got a lot of positive feedback as well. And of course I must thank the company for making first the Turbo Pascal series of compilers and now the Delphi series of visual IDEs.
<p>I'm starting to get some precious feedback. The first readers who helped improving this material quite a lot are Charles Wood and Wyatt Wong. Mark Greenhaw helped with some editing the text. Rafael Barranco-Droege offered a lot of technical corrections and language editing. Thanks.
